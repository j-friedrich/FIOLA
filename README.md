# FIOLA
An accelerated pipeline for Fluorescence Imaging OnLine1Analysis. FIOLA exploits computational graphs and accelerated hardware to preprocess fluorescence imaging movies to extract neural activity at speeds in excess of 300Hz on standard fields of view for calcium imaging and at over 400Hz for voltage imaging movies.

## INSTALL
conda create --name fiola python==3.8
conda activate fiola
pip install -r requirements_simple.txt
